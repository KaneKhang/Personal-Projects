## INTRODUCTION ABOUT THE PROJECT
# Context
Upon receiving a loan application, the company must assess the applicant's profile to decide on loan approval, which involves two types of risks:
* Not approving the loan for an applicant likely to repay would result in a loss of business for the company.
* Approving the loan for an applicant likely to default would lead to a financial loss 
The provided data contains information about loan applications at the time of applying, categorized into two scenarios:
* Clients facing payment difficulties: These individuals have a history of late payments for more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments in the loan sample.
All other cases: This category includes clients who made timely payments.
When a client applies for a loan, there are four possible outcomes:
* Approved: The company approves the loan application.
* Cancelled: The client cancels the application either due to a change of mind or 
receiving unfavorable terms.
* Refused: The company rejects the loan application because the client does not meet 
their requirements.
* Unused offer: The client cancels the loan at different stages of the process. 
# Objective
To identify patterns indicating clients who might have difficulty paying their installments. 
This information will be used to make informed decisions, such as denying loans, reducing loan amounts, or offering higher interest rates to riskier applicants. Understanding the factors driving loan defaults will help the company manage its portfolio and assess risks effectively.
# Main solved questions
1) What are contributors that had effect to the target output in the dataset? Listing out the contributors?
2) Comparing and indicating the main features of those variances that lead to customers’ difficulty in paying their installments?
3) Is there any relevant to the previous application to cause the customers’ difficulty in paying their installments?
4) Ranking the level of influences and showing the top causes to the main output?
