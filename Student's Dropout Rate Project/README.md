## INTRODUCTION ABOUT THE PROJECT
# Context
Having a successful education at university level is an important development prerequisite for work in particular and the socio-economy of a country in general. Therefore, the dropout rate of students is a dilemma for higher education institutions to contribute to this development. In order to track and develop students' educational paths, an educational research institute collected and synthesized 4424 samples of student to analyze and determine the solution to improve students' advance results
# Objective
Taking the advantages of data mining and analysis, the report aims determine groups of features and behaviors that leads to dropped out students in the university and offer appropriate solutions for improvement
# Main questions
1) What are trends and symptoms to turn a student into dropout group?
2) What are correlations between these features?
3) Which features contribute significantly to the output of student status? Explain
# Main solutions from the project (See report file in detail)
* Increase scholarship funds for students who have parents in the unskilled working group, have a history  of not completing tuition fees and loans during the academic year.
* Organize more experiential lessons, early orientation, clubs in many different careers for students right from the moment of admission so that students have more opportunities to look back and change majors in the first year if they feel unsuitable or find out what they really want to pursue
* In addition to the factors in finance, economics and disciplines mentioned above, it is recommended that schools need to collect more information and dig deeper into the causes of courses that lead to low scores in students (collected specifically in this dataset)

*NOTE: Since the main purpose of this report is to represent to the Stakeholder, please see the PowerPoint file as the final product instead of Power BI tool (used as visualizing charts for attachment only)
